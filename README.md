# Covnet-Image-Classifier
Udacity: Deep Learning Nanodegree - Project 2

#Image Classification
##Introduction

In this project, you'll classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The dataset consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects. The dataset will need to be preprocessed, then train a convolutional neural network on all the samples. You'll normalize the images, one-hot encode the labels, build a convolutional layer, max pool layer, and fully connected layer. At then end, you'll see their predictions on the sample images.

##Instructions

    Login to your AWS instance
    Download the repo
        git clone https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning.git
    Change to the project directory
        cd deep-learning/image-classification/
    Enter your deep learning environment
        Mac/Linux: source activate dl
        Windows: activate dl
    Run the notebook
        jupyter notebook dlnd_image_classification.ipynb
    Go to the instance (x.x.x.x:8888) in your web browser
        The x.x.x.x is your instance's ip address
    Follow the instructions in the notebook will lead you through the project.
    Ensure you've passed the unit tests in the notebook before you submit the project!

##Submission

Ensure you've passed all the unit tests in the notebook.
Ensure you pass all points on the rubric.

When you're done with the project, please save the notebook as an HTML file. You can do this by going to the File menu in the notebook and choosing "Download as" > HTML. Ensure you submit both the Jupyter Notebook and it's HTML version together. Package the "dlnd_image_classification.ipynb", "helper.py", "problem_unittests.py", and the HTML file into a zip archive, or
    push the files from your GitHub repo.
